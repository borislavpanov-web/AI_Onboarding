# AI_Onboarding project

This project aims to develop a chatbot capable of collecting various types of information, such as files, free text, and hyperlinks, and providing answers to user questions. The chatbot will be trained using a base model to enable intelligent responses. It will be used by the employees in Blankfactor to help them with the onboarding process.

# Back end Development

The back-end of the chatbot is developed using .NET, a framework for building scalable and performant applications. The back-end API handles user requests, trains the model, communicates with it to generate responses, and sends them back to the front-end. Customize the API endpoints and logic to fit your project requirements.
